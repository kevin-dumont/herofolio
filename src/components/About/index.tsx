                  I'm looking for challenges. So, I wanted to follow some rules
                  during the conception :
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    All illustrations (shapes, characters, icons,...) are PURE
                    CSS. Absolutely zero image, svg or font-icon was used.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Each illustration, taken seprately (for example, the hero),
                    are single HTML elements. It use mostly CSS gradients, and
                    pseudo-elements, before/after.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Elements are all animated with CSS transition property.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This website is developed with React and Typescript. No
                    videogame engine like PIXI was used. You can see the
